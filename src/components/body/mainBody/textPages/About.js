        <br />I freelance when I can, mostly building custom websites that you
        canâ€™t get from a template. My place in the world seems to be at the{" "}
        <span>intersection of creativity and logic</span>. I approach each
        problem as a <span>learning experience</span> that informs the rest of
        the project.
